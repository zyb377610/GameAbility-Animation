/**
 * Thin runtime bridge to the Take Recorder plugin. The plugin is reached
 * exclusively through UFunction reflection so this module never link-depends
 * on TakeRecorder; if the plugin is not enabled in the user's project every
 * call returns false / no-op cleanly.
 *
 * The integration drives the live Take Recorder panel rather than building
 * a UTakeRecorderSources from scratch. The user opens the panel, configures
 * sources (player pawn, actors of interest), and pie_record_arm with
 * take_record=true then calls Start/Stop on that already-configured panel
 * in lockstep with BeginPIE / EndPIE.
